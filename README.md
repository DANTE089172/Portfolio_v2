### About & History of this project üéØ
---------------------------------------------------

Here I will insert a history of the development of this website.
Where everything started, 
How I got here,
This is not necessarily a finished website, there are many things I would like to do

You can see a list of some of these 'things' below under a "work in progress"

### Credit where credit is due: Brittany Chiang
---------------------------------------------------

As mentioned in the about section, while I built this website from scratch myself, I heavily used Brittany Chiang's website as inspiration and therefore all credit goes to her.

#  Forking and Building/Running


## Forking the repo

Yes, you can fork this repo. <br>
However, please give proper credit by linking back to brittanychiang.com. Thanks!
<br><br>
Website - https://brittanychiang.com/ <br>
GitHub - https://github.com/bchiang7/v4
<br>


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
