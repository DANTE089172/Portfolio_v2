<h1 align='center'> Welcome & Introductory </h1>

### About & History of this project ü§ì
---------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time, I embarked on a journey into the world of web development. 
Inspired by a captivating portfolio website, I was initially demoralized by the advanced technologies used, such as Framer-Motion-Animations, Gatsby.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, I saw this as an opportunity for growth and dedicated myself to learning. Over six months, I tirelessly studied and practiced, acquiring the skills to build the once seemingly unattainable portfolio project from scratch
<br/>
<br/>
Not only did I replicate the design, but I also added my own innovative ideas and enhancements. This experience taught me the importance of tenacity, adaptability, and continuous learning in web development.
<br/>
I hope my journey inspires other developers and showcases my ability to overcome challenges and strive for excellence. My story reflects resilience, adaptability, and a commitment to personal and professional development, making me a valuable asset to any team or organization.

### Credit where credit is due: <em>Brittany Chiang</em> üôè
---------------------------------------------------

As mentioned in the about section, while I built this website from scratch myself, I heavily used Brittany Chiang's website as inspiration and therefore all credit goes to her.

### Previouse Versions and Fixes üë¥
---------------------------------------------------

<!-- VERSION 2.1 -->
<details>
<summary>
<h3> Version 2.1 </h3>
</summary>
A list of all the issues I have fixed and features I have added.

<!-- NAVBAR SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> NavBar Section </h6></summary>
<li> Create interactive logo and fixing the broken link
<pre><code>
Initially I wanted this to be an interactive logo that would have some kind of a hover effect.
However, I decided against it and rather put in a simple tailwind animation.
Eventually I want this to reload the page.
</code></pre>
<li> Clean up the mobile version of the navbar - centering and styling
<pre><code>
This was a small fix, as there was simple implementation of some styling fixes 
I also decided to include links to my different social media pages. 
</code></pre>
</details> 

<!-- HOME/BANNER SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Banner Page section </h6></summary>
<li> Increase the size and responsivness of the heading text's 
<pre><code>
This was a small fix, as there was simple implementation of some styling fixes.
As well as some media queries.
</code></pre>
<li> Update button link & styling
<pre><code>
SolutionüéØ
</code></pre>
</details> 

<!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> About Section </h6></summary>
<li> Complete overhaul of the layout of this section - ersponsivness issues
<pre><code>
Initially I was using flex box to handle this, 
however this was causing responsivness issues in the image section.
I decided to implement a grid style for this section on larger screens
then add a media querey to turn it back into flex style for mobile devices 
and to float the image in the text portion for mobile device viewing.
</code></pre>
<li> Update the styling of favourite technologies heading
<pre><code>
This was a small fix, as there was simple implementation of some styling updates
</code></pre>
</details>

<!-- EXPERIENCES SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Experiences section </h6></summary>
<li> Creating a mobile view section section - with a hidden horizontal screen 
<pre><code>
This was decevingly less easy to implement as I would have to create a parent div for the sidebar.
This was necessary to handle the overflow-x
Additionally I wanted to hide the scroll bar and had to implement @layers in the global.css
</code></pre>
<li> Decrease the gap between 'About' & 'Experiences' section
<pre><code>
Relativley simple however had to balance this between media queries and screen sizes and padding.
</code></pre>
</details>

<!-- PROJECTS SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Projects Section </h6></summary>
<li> Make titel fo projects clickable and with a hover effect. (mobile and desktop view)
<pre><code>
Solution üéØ
</code></pre>
<li> Fix responsivness of noteworthy projects forsmall mobile devices
<pre><code>
I solved this by turning this from a gird layout to a flex-box layout and then having min and max widths.
</code></pre>
<li> Fix animation loading bug 
<pre><code>
My previouse fix was causing some issues of when having the more noteworthy projects open
would cause issues when scrolling to the bottom and scrolling back up.
I had to implement an auto-closing of more projects when scrolling past the projects section into contact.
</code></pre>
<li> Import small photos for moible view
<pre><code>
This was a challenge as I wanted to implement the pictures of the project as a background image.
So what I ended up doing was;
- I edited/photo-shopped the images to work as a background images.
- Implementing a tailwind style for the different background images.
- Then using mediaqueries I could swap between the two different styles.
Eventually I want to clean this code up and keep it DRY
</code></pre>
</details>

<!-- Contact & Footer Section -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Contact & Footer Section </h6></summary>
<li> Fix footer bug not showing up in medium screen sizes
<pre><code>
This was simple fix of amending how the media queries were being implemented.
</code></pre>
<li> Adding credit to Brittany Chiangs website on all resolutions
<pre><code>
I added links to Brittany's website in the footer
I also made it so this section will alwasy be shown no matter the screen size
</code></pre>
<li> Increase size of headings and responsivness of text
<pre><code>
This was simple styling and media-queries implementation
</code></pre>
</details>

</details> 
<!-- CLOSING -->

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- VERSION 2.0 -->
<details>
<summary>
<h3> Version 2.0 </h3>
</summary>

<!-- NAVBAR SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> NavBar Section </h6></summary>
<li> Create a Logo for my portfolio and include it in the Navbar Section
<pre><code>
Created my logo with online logo maker
</code></pre>
<li> Create a mobile view for the Navbar section with media queries 
<pre><code>
This was a little challenging at first as I had to rework my initial simple navbar.
I needed it to be able to incorporate all the other links that would be lost in the smaller mobile screen 
- such as my email and images with links to github, twitter, linkedin etc.
Further I wanted the mobile view to have animated-loading with framer-motion 
</code></pre>
<li> Adding a button with a link to a pdf of my CV 
<pre><code>
Simple enough to incorporate as just had to include my pdf in the assets folder, 
then wrap it with an anchor tag to link open it to open in a new tab. 
</code></pre>
</details> 

<!-- HOME/BANNER SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Banner Page section </h6></summary>
<li> Include a auto typing heading effect with job titles 
<pre><code>
I have used this in a previouse portfolio, 
a portfolio I actually built with python and the flask framework.  
So I found an npm package that had the same capabilities and followed the documentation to implement it.  
Simple enough   
</code></pre>
<li> Include a delayed loading effect 
<pre><code>
Again I have used framer-motion in some past projects.
However because of all the different moving parts in this project, 
I had to find a way to make it simpler to understand and use. 
I did this by rather applying this to sections and divs instead of individual elements.
</code></pre>
<li> Update the links and sizing of the headings with media queries 
<pre><code>
Very simply just used media queries within tailwind.
</code></pre>
</details> 

<!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> About Section </h6></summary>
<li> Create Skills-Icons with some hover effects
<pre><code>
Simply added some images to my assets folder
Imported them to the component 
Applied some tailwind styling with simple animation
Applied media queries to handle responsivness
</code></pre>
<li> Update the profile image and try replicate the design and animations of Britanny Chiang
<pre><code>
This was challenging to replicating the animation
I solved the first problem by wrapping the children div in a container div
using groups, group-styling and absolute styling, as well as z indexes
</code></pre>
<li> Making the image dynamic 
<pre><code>
The second problem I decided to keep it more simple for mobile devices
by simplifying the image and then floating it inside the text section.
</code></pre>
</details>

<!-- EXPERIENCES SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Experiences section </h6></summary>
<li> Replicate the same style as Brittany Chang
<pre><code>
When I initially tried to do this, it was getting a little convoluded.
I initially tried to keep this in one component, however soon realised this would not work.
So I had to create pages then create a sidebar that could link to the different pages 
</code></pre>
<li> Trying to implement a way to keep this code dry and easier to update
<pre><code>
I did this by seperating my work experiences into a seperate folder 
I could then call on the different files depending on the onClick 
</code></pre>
</details>

<!-- PROJECTS SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Projects Section </h6></summary>
<li> Fixing a bug with medium screen sizes causing componenets to dissapear
<pre><code>
This was a simple fix with an error in how I was using and implementing the media-queries
</code></pre>
<li> Create a special Mobile view for capston projects
<pre><code>
This was a challenge as I wanted to implement the pictures of the project as a background image.
So what I ended up doing was;
- I edited/photo-shopped the images to work as a background images.
- Implementing a tailwind style for the different background images.
- Then using mediaqueries I could swap between the two different styles.
Eventually I want to clean this code up and keep it DRY
</code></pre>
<li> Fixing a bug for styling issues in the 'other noteworthy projects'
<pre><code>
This bug was created because of the framer-motion implementation.
There was an issue of how the different cards were being called in.
</code></pre>
